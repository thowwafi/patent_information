As may be implemented in accordance with one or more embodiments, a voltage level is controlled for a field effect transistor (FET) having a floating gate and a target operating voltage above which the FET would be overcharged and around which the FET has a nominal operating range. Pulse circuitry is configured to apply energy to the floating gate in pulses, in operation the applied energy being pulsed low relative to the gate's target operating voltage, and then being changed by adjusting successive pulses until the gate reaches the target operating voltage. A feedback circuit samples a voltage level of, and enables the pulse circuitry to apply pulsed energy to, the floating gate for directing operation of the FET based on the target operating voltage in the nominal operating range.

The semiconductor wafer includes an active layer over a silicon layer, wherein the active layer is at a top side, and a bottom side exposes the silicon layer. While the wafer is attached to the support structure, an infrared laser beam is focused through a portion of the silicon layer to create a modification region along saw lanes located between neighboring die of the plurality of die. Afterwards, a metal layer is formed on the exposed silicon layer at the bottom side of the semiconductor wafer. The metal layer is attached to an expansion tape, and the wafer is singulated by extending the expansion tape to separate the die of the plurality of die along the saw lane. A first singulated die of the plurality of die is packaged to form a packaged semiconductor device.

The tile body is placed in a mould (10-13), wherein a visible side (21) of the tile body (20) is directed toward the mould bottom. An adhesive layer (35) is arranged on the back side (22) of the tile body. The mould is then filled with a concrete mortar (40) and the concrete mortar is compacted into the concrete body (45). The adhesive layer is provided in an inner area on the back side of the tile body and leaves clear a peripheral area which extends therearound. The concrete body extends over the peripheral area and the concrete mortar is compacted into the concrete body at a pressure of more than 8 khPa (≈80 tons/m2), particularly at a pressure of between 10 and 50 khPa (≈100-500 tons/m2), and preferably at a pressure of between about 10 and 12 khPa (≈100-120 tons/m2).

The duty cycle adjuster is further configured to iteratively adjust the first and second duty cycles to generate first and second differential output signals (O1, O2) having third and fourth duty cycles that are within a predefined range of the reference duty cycle, respectively. During each iteration, the duty cycle adjuster adjusts the first and second duty cycles based on correction bits (B1-B4) that are generated based on a duty cycle detection signal (DS) that indicates whether the third duty cycle is greater than or less than the fourth duty cycle, and a lock signal (LOCK) that is activated when the duty cycle detection signal toggles from one logic state to another.

In one example, a method includes demodulating a broadcast signal associated with a radio-frequency transmission using a desired-channel bandwidth setting and, in response, provide a first frequency-selective demodulated signal (e.g., MPX signal in an FM broadcast) and provide a magnitude indication, such as the raw signal level, of a second demodulated signal that is less frequency selective than the first frequency-selective demodulated signal. A level estimation circuit is used to assess a running representation (or effective average) of the magnitude indication over time. In this manner, a speed or rate at which the level estimator assesses the running representation is controlled based on a degree of deviation or offset as indicated by the first frequency-selective demodulated signal relative to a carrier frequency used for the broadcast signal.

The method is part of a manufacturing process wherein a virgin polymer is produced from a polymerization process employing at least a monomer or a comonomer as a feedstock. The monomer or the comonomer is selected from the group consisting of organic polar monomers, inorganic monomers, vinyl aromatic monomers, conjugated dienes, and mixtures thereof. In the method, the polymer in solid, liquid or molten state is brought into contact with a fluid solvent or an extraction fluid in a supercritical state or near supercritical state. The contact is at controlled temperature and pressure, allowing the fluid solvent to diffuse into the polymer and extract the impurities intended to remove.

In particular, the tracking system or other client device may request and then receive a position estimate from the positioning system. The tracking system could then make a determination that the position estimate is incorrect, such as by determining that it is an outlier relative to a location trace, for instance. Responsive to this determination, the tracking system may transmit, to the position system, an indication of radio node(s) associated with the incorrect position estimate. Based on this indication, the positioning system could then exclude one or more of those radio node(s) from a radio map, thereby improving quality of the radio map and in turn quality of future position estimates, among other advantages.

During each iteration, the duty cycle adjuster adjusts the first and second duty cycles based on correction bits (B1-B4) that are generated based on a duty cycle detection signal (DS) that indicates whether the third duty cycle is greater than or less than the fourth duty cycle, and a lock signal (LOCK) that is activated when the duty cycle detection signal toggles from one logic state to another.

The approach also involves calculating a path probability for the possible path, wherein the path probability indicates a likelihood that the possible path is a true path of the vehicle over the road graph. The approach further involves assigning a weighted vehicle count to the road link and/or one or more other road links contained in the possible path, wherein the weighted vehicle count is based on the path probability.

The method further includes, in response to the controlled switching order, converting an input voltage of a first voltage level to an output voltage of a second voltage level while mitigating the voltage overstress of the parasitic bipolar transistors of the plurality of power switches.

The approach, for example, involves processing probe data at a lane level to determine at least one forward forming shockwave associated with a congestion front of a mobile roadwork zone on at least one lane. The approach also involves providing data indicating the mobile roadwork zone as an output. The approach further involves determining a propagation rate of the mobile roadwork zone.
